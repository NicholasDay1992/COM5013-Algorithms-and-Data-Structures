    "* <b>Fast Allocation/Deallocation</b>. Allocating and deallocating memory on the stack is fast and accomplished by simply adjusting the stack pointer value. The stack pointer is moved up to allocate and down to deallocate space (some systems may apply the opposite down/up convention).\n",
    "* <b>Automatic Memory Management</b>. Memory space on the stack is managed automatically. Space for local variables is automatically allocated when a function is called and deallocated when a function exits.\n",
    "* <b>No Fragmentation</b>. Memory allocation is sequential and consistent, eliminating memory fragmentation and ensuring the efficient use of free space.\n",
    "* <b>Predictable Lifespan</b>. Variables on the stack exist only for the duration of the function or scope they are in. This predictability makes code easier to write and read.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack disadvantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Limited Size</b>. Stack memory is limited in size, and once it is exhausted, it results in a stack overflow, causing the program to crash. This makes the stack unsuitable for storing large amounts of data.\n",
    "* <b>Limited Access</b>. The Last in First Out (LIFO) principle of the stack means that standard operations primarily interact with the top of the stack. Direct random access to other locations in the stack beyond current scope boundaries can lead to errors.\n",
    "* <b>No Resizing</b>. The stack does not allow memory block resizing once they are allocated. For instance, if you allocate too little memory for an array on the stack, it cannot be resized like with dynamically allocated memory.\n"

    "* <b>Dynamic Allocation</b>. Programs can allocate memory at runtime based on their needs, resulting in more efficient memory use. \n",
    "* <b>Variable Lifetime</b>. Objects allocated on the heap persist until they are explicitly deallocated or the program ends. They can outlive the function call that created them, which is especially useful for data that needs to persist across multiple function calls or even for the duration of the program.\n",
    "* <b>Large Memory Pool</b>. The heap provides a much larger memory pool than the stack. It is suitable for allocating larger data structures or ones that might grow, like arrays or lists.\n",
    "* <b>Globally Accessible</b>. Heap memory is globally accessible, meaning it can be accessed and modified by any part of the code and is not bound by the call stack. Sharing data across different parts of a program or even between threads is a clear benefit.\n",
    "* <b>Support for Complex Structures</b>. Heap memory can build and manage complex data structures like trees, graphs, and linked lists, which might require frequent and dynamic memory allocations and deallocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap disadvantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Hands-on Memory Management</b>. Heap memory requires explicit management. Developers must manually allocate and deallocate memory, which can introduce potential errors and consume additional resources.\n",
    "* <b>Memory Leaks</b>. If the memory is not deallocated after it serves its function, it may result in memory leaks. This means the program consumes memory, eventually leading to out-of-memory errors, especially in long-running applications.\n",
    "* <b>Fragmentation</b>. Memory on the heap is allocated and deallocated dynamically. This can lead to scattered, unused memory blocks (external fragmentation) or small wasted spaces within the allocated blocks (internal fragmentation).\n",
    "* <b>Slower Access</b>. Accessing variables on the heap is generally slower than accessing variables on the stack.\n",
    "* <b>Dangling Pointers</b>. Pointers referencing deallocated memory locations can become dangling pointers. Accessing or modifying data through such pointers can lead to undefined behavior."
