    "Hash Maps allow users to search a data structure via characters instead of integer index positions. The characters (string) are converted to integers by a process of 'hashing'. This hashing function will look up the ASCII value of each character. Each integer value is then multiplied by its position in the string to achieve a unique number. These are added together to create a large number. To prevent having to allocate a large number of elements, the modulo sign (%) calculates a smaller number to reduce the size of elements.\n",
